### i love building things and telling stories

I've built lots of webapps, a few desktop apps and just a few mobile apps. I'm most at home with JS/Node-based stacks, especially React/Next, but I'm also comfortable with Python and Rust. I've also done a fair bit of data analysis and visualization using R, DataWrapper, Flourish, d3.js and other tools.

I've also reported on AAPI politics, labor organizing, policing and more for the Sacramento Bee, AAJA Voices, The Yappie and other publications. [One of my investigations at the Bee](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article276812896.html) pushed the California legislature to [commission a $1 million study](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article278874669.html) on the working conditions of migrant herders in the state.
